Hello  Jeremias 
Can you please share a video of web exiting print engine and entering next unit in line 
I also notice you are not using the rider roller on tecnau rewinder is there a reason why this is not used ? if it is used it may help with issues you are seeing and would be also good to eliminate this.

Replaced failed rear elevator motor then found had different issue with encoder mismatch. Rechecked levels and initialised service pca but same error.  Replaced front actuator as well and press is now working.  I am not sure if both actuators were actually intermittently failing or if there has been a manufacturer change of the parts but both together solved the problem.

Please be aware that if you run the press like this there will be less aerosol than usual. It is important to frequently check the print bar area for any kind of build up and run servicing routines while the press is in this state. I will dispatch an FSE to investigate the cause of the pressure drop for you guys. 

请注意，如果你这样运行印刷机，气雾量将会比平时少。重要的是要经常检查印刷条区域是否有任何积聚，并在印刷机处于这种状态时执行维护程序。我会派一名现场服务工程师来帮你们调查压力下降的原因。

2025-12-02 20:44 - Tom Koch (RSE) (External Comments)
OK. I will have you temporarily adjust the pressure set point. To do this hit the middle button on the pressure switch that you sent a picture of, the bottom right number should start flashing. Press the up arrow button on the left side until the flashing button reaches -12. Then hit the center button again. This should allow you to run. 

好的。我将让你暂时调整压力设定点。为此，按下你发送照片中压力开关的中间按钮，右下角的数字应该开始闪烁。然后按左侧的上箭头按钮，直到闪烁的数字达到 -12。然后再次按中间按钮。这应该可以让你运行。

2025-12-02 20:34 - Tom Koch (RSE) (External Comments)
Please verify the suction from the aerosol duct on the print bar. You can do this by holding the thin not sticky backing to double sided tape up to the aerosol duct. The vacuum pressure should be enough to support the tape backing on its own. Please let me know the results and I will decide how to proceed from there. 

请检查打印条喷雾管的吸力。你可以通过将双面胶带的薄不粘背面贴近喷雾管来检测。真空压力应该足够让胶带背面独自支撑。请告诉我结果，我会据此决定下一步操作。

If checking and reseating the hoses is not effective, please fins the pressure switch and attach a picture of it to the case. It will be located on the gear side of the arch. I will attach a picture of a pressure switch, yours should look similar.

Hello, Please check that all of the aerosol hoses are properly secured to the ducts. It is common for this error to occur if the hoses are not secured properly after the cleaning aerosol ducts pm. 

您好，请检查所有气雾管是否正确固定在管道上。如果清洁气雾管道维护后管子没有正确固定，这种错误很常见。

TIll Date		
Additional Note		Tecnau rewinder seems to have shifted from vibration. When we run heavy substrates this can cause heavy vibrations and the rewinder looks to have shifted. This is now causing the rewinder to crease the paper as it comes out. It can also be observed as paper is running from the rewinder to the press, the paper path is not straight. It's being slightly pulled back to the press from the rewinder. Rewinder needs to be moved and trammed and anchored to prevent any more movement in the future. I will be escalating this case for HP to have eyes on case. I also have photos for the support engineer on the case.

hello Said,
i powered off rpu13, took out fan#3 and blew it with compressed air
also swapped fan#3 that blows to one cpu with fan#8 that blows to two ram modules
powered on rpu13 and the error remained on position #3! i don't understand!
please check again and note that the fan that was noisy is now on position #8
awaiting for your reply, stay safe!

Hello Ovi,
Sorry for the delayed response. I connected and noticed that Fan Block 3 is degraded. Could you please check if the fan is dirty and clean it if necessary? Also, confirm whether the fan is working properly.
Let me know. Thank you.

@Nick Fernley

Hi nick, my engineer is struggling to find feasible flight times to Newquay tomorrow, so it may be Thursday when he gets on site.

I will keep you updated, if we manage to find any alternative routes to get to you quicker.

2025-12-02 17:10 - Nick Fernley (External Comments)
Have lowered speeds  down from full  speed we normally run at and is still double printing going to try cleaning out turn bar area as that's before side 2 printing and hopefully if that doesn't improve it the engineer can resolve.

2025-12-02 17:06 - Exequiel Indovino (APE) (External Comments)
Thanks for the pictures Nick.
It´s better but I guess is not good enough to keep printing at high speed (152m/min). Is there any chance to print at lower speeds witth this tensions??

As Melody said our Engineer will be with you around mid-morning tomorrow.

I´ve seen you set Tensions at 80N and the doubling has been reduced but still not good right?
Can you share a picture of the printout??
Is worth if you run another SUC with this tensions and check it again please.

Thank you.
Ciao.

2025-12-02 16:36 - Nick Fernley (External Comments)
job finished even with reduced tension its still double printing

2025-12-02 16:32 - Nick Fernley (External Comments)
job is running now about 4 mins 30 seconds left on job run

2025-12-02 16:25 - Nick Fernley (External Comments)
Have been told by my manager to run this 5 minute run on a slightly lower tension will start running now! Will run some of the job i was attempting.

2025-12-02 16:13 - Exequiel Indovino (APE) (External Comments)
Looks like the Side2 is completly gone because the tension control.
I was not able to capture traces to check the Tensions. For that I need you to run the for 5min to capture traces.
Can you run for 5 min to capture the traces?? I´m connected to the press.

Could be a problem with a Load Cell on side2. 
Paper stability is not good and we need to send an FSE to review it.
I´ll make the request right now and will come back to you as soon as possible.

2025-12-02 16:03 - Nick Fernley (External Comments)
I've run a couple more to see if i could put press up full speed and its completely gone again with pe1 running at about 125 nm and pe2 dropping to around 90 nm when i've got tensions set to 100. No the optimizer sometimes doesn't calibrate for some mono jobs but is not always needed

2025-12-02 15:55 - Exequiel Indovino (APE) (External Comments)
Hello Nick.
Ok, lets try it and will see if it has solved the problem.
I´ve downloaded the IPC images and I can´t see the Optimizer... Are you able to see the OP on the fisical plot of the SUC??

2025-12-02 15:46 - Nick Fernley (External Comments)
Hello exequiel have set up test mono paper profile and have run 4 calibrations and image on both sides looks better on calibration screen. I'm going to splice a new core on rewinder and try running the job to see if it runs better.

2025-12-02 15:23 - Exequiel Indovino (APE) (External Comments)
Good afternoon Nick.
I´d like to ask you to make a copy of the paper profile ""Mono Performance"" creating a new one with different name (i.e Test) and set the aligment to default to start over from scratch with new alignments.
You will need to run several SUC until get green values. Once alignment is applied, run the production job again to check the results.

Tension applied are 110N, which is the gsm of this paper??

Let me once you finish the actions.
Thank you.
Ciao.

Case Task: 
The HSDC collected shows printing speed variations very high and side2 also has huge peaks on drive roller and idle rollers.
We need to check and calibrate the loadcells on side2.



2025-12-02 16:25 - Exequiel Indovino (APE) (Internal comments)
Case Task: 
We´ve reseated the alignment to default and run several SUC to get green alignment and check the PQ after this.
The setpoint of Tension was set to 100N and we can see a huge variation on side2 just running the SUC...
It causes misalignment on side2 and paper path is not stable to print correctly.
I need an FSE to calibrate the load cells on side2 because the press is down. 
Autodispatch has been made 5 min ago.

Please let me know the availability of the FSE and communicate to the customer.

Thank you.
Ciao.

I arrived onsite when the problem already happened . Sam , the maintenance guy , said he did not do anything unusual , he just pulled the dryer and heard the noise of the metal parts being caught . Not really clear what was the cause.

Hi Miguel

I have power Cycled the unit
I am not allowed to open the electrical cabinet (OH&S)

This happened before on the afternoon shift, maybe a month ago

2025-12-02 21:57 - Miguel Perez (FSE) (External Comments)
Hello, probably you already did that, but just to double check:
- Did you do a power cycle of the module?
- Did you check in the electrical cabinet if there is a tripped breaker?

- Have you ever had this issue before? If so, how long ago?

If you can send pictures of the error message you're having, it will be great. Please let us know if you want a visit of our technician

[4:34 p.m., 2/12/2025] Nic Wibowo, IVE Australia Operator: This happened before. Maybe FSE Ben Tooma could give some input
[4:34 p.m., 2/12/2025] Nic Wibowo, IVE Australia Operator: I did, all seems to be ok
[4:35 p.m., 2/12/2025] Miguel Pérez: That means there is something wrong with the e-stop circuit itself. I will take a look remotely
[4:36 p.m., 2/12/2025] Nic Wibowo, IVE Australia Operator: Thank you, mate
[4:54 p.m., 2/12/2025] Miguel Pérez: I'm having issues entering to TS01 or TS02 to get the Siemens HMI. By chance, do you know how to log in to TS02 or TS02?
[5:02 p.m., 2/12/2025] Nic Wibowo, IVE Australia Operator: No idea, mate. Sorry
[5:03 p.m., 2/12/2025] Miguel Pérez: Did you do a press software restart?
[5:04 p.m., 2/12/2025] Nic Wibowo, IVE Australia Operator: I did. Restarted and Rebooted
[5:07 p.m., 2/12/2025] Miguel Pérez: I am talking about this one
[5:07 p.m., 2/12/2025] Nic Wibowo, IVE Australia Operator: Yes, that's what I meant
[5:07 p.m., 2/12/2025] Nic Wibowo, IVE Australia Operator: Also that
[5:07 p.m., 2/12/2025] Miguel Pérez: OK, understood
[5:08 p.m., 2/12/2025] Miguel Pérez: Does the EPIC module itself have an error message or something like that?
[5:10 p.m., 2/12/2025] Nic Wibowo, IVE Australia Operator: No fault on the Epics
[5:28 p.m., 2/12/2025] Miguel Pérez: Well... it seems to be an error code specific to EPIC. I will create a visit on site to check this.

Hello,

I spoke to Brad and we couldn't get hold of anyone onsite. The alarm 7907 is usually the problem with the contacts between printhead and the pocket board. I am not sure what you've done, Please try to clean the pocket board piano contacts with IPA , swap the printhead with an known good position to see if there is any change.
I go ahead to dispatch a FSE onsite in the morning since press is down, Please update here or call us at 8774313693 if you need any remote support or want to cancel the dispatch.

No, its not critical as vision can still read printhead health and aligment data, you can run the press without issues. 
Just keep it in mind to do it in the future if you want brighter images on the vision

Marco? if is important to do the flatfield cal now, i can do it, no problem.

if you're ok with this too, of course.

2025-12-03 11:56 - Ovidiu Puscas (External Comments)
I did in the past a flatfield calibration, but can we do it in another day please? Because we have some urgent print that is waiting for us. :)

2025-12-03 11:54 - Marco Fernández (DFE) (External Comments)
Were the images on both sides brighter before Ovi intervention? 

Are you or Ovi trained on how to run a flatfield calibration in order to calibrate the lighting?

2025-12-03 11:51 - Ovidiu Puscas (External Comments)
I don't know what really happen but now is working, but with dark images and warning on IPC. Maybe from the software restart?!

2025-12-03 11:43 - Marco Fernández (DFE) (External Comments)
The aligment issues you mention should be gone after  applying the updates and running a second calibration

2025-12-03 11:42 - Ovidiu Puscas (External Comments)
Done with startup calibration.
Still we have something now on the alignment. Till now doesn't appear nothing.

2025-12-03 11:42 - Marco Fernández (DFE) (External Comments)
I have read the case notes on the older case and seen the calibration resulTS.

To me it seems Ovi solved the issue yesterday after replacing the PSU, and now the IPC is working as expected providing images on both sides.

2025-12-03 11:36 - Ovidiu Puscas (External Comments)
CS21536813 - this is the inital case opened by Ovi but i choose to open a new one because there no one answered. If you can read there to update.

2025-12-03 11:32 - Ovidiu Puscas (External Comments)
hello Marco,

Yes i will run a startup cal right now.

I have connected to MP394 and IPC seems to be fine. 

Could you run a calibration so I can see the error you are referring to?

Best Regards,
Marco

I have checked the ink system throughout. I cannot see any air in the lines, the pressure gauges are all reading between 6 and 7 kPa, and the pumps are both running at a reasonable speed - 34 and 27 respectively. I can see on the printed output samples left by the operators lots of streaks in black, some pen stitch misalignments, and die uniformity anomalies.
The only way to resolve these issues is to run multiple SUCs and accept each result as it progresses. It is likely that the customer will see some more pen failures as a result of the air starvation. Unfortunately there is no way to mitigate that since press has run for 24h since meaning that the septums no longer need bleeding.

2025-12-03 08:37 - Q1 CPIARC (External Comments)
Just to update, 
The issue isn't an air leak, just air in system after a filter change. The system was run for the night after the change and the BA wasn't connected. 
This was only noticed in the morning at around 0700 yesterday. The air mostly was in and around Arch 1 BA, but obviously in the system in general. 
Balanced out motor pulling percentages, over the last 24hrs black has come down to it's SP of 26   BA is currently on 33 with a SP of 26. 

Will keep an eye on it until Martin arrives and hand over to him

The L3 operator bypassed the printbar ink lines to change the ink filters but afterwards forgot to put the ink lines back to the normal run position before handing the press back,  meaning that ALL of the pens on the press eventually became starved of ink. In all 40 pens were replaced overnight - 32 BA and 8 black.

We ran this reel this morning between 10.30am - 12pm. Job name is 02-1106-01172-74237_100gsm
There is a V2 v3 & v4 still on the press. Once we printed, it wouldnt resend to print again.

2025-12-02 15:27 - Victor Martin (DFE) (External Comments)
Good afternoon Mike,

Do you have any approximate timestamp/job name or something that could help us to look to the appropriate data in your system?

I would start checking tensions/encoder signals for the runs using this paper/production but for that I would need to know when this has happened.

Is this happening every time you are running this stock? It is something easy  reproducible from your side?

Thank you!
Victor

Purge all is a script that we can run for you. It purges all of the data in the DFE including all of the jobs on the job submission page.

Hi Irvin, I was able to get the previewer page functional, but it is currently running very slow and taking several minutes to ge the preview loaded. We've ran through troubleshooting and the next step to try to get the previewer running faster would be a purge all. We can either leave the previewer as is or try a purge all if it works for you guys

restarted previewer services on the prerip and App1, rebooted rips, prerip, and app1, and also ran a purge all. Job previewer is technically functional but it runs incredibly slow. Over 10 minutes to open the preview for USA today. Elevating to T3 team to find a workable solution.

SP32 | B&F | DFE not ripping and buffering JDF files sent via Connex

Both presses SP32 and SP11 were shutdown for long weekend - Thanksgiving holiday, so early on Monday, Bowanie called me directly asking for help on it so I tried to help in the phone while driving, so we tried the procedure to clean JDF job history on APP1 but it did not help to solve the issue. 

I got onsite early in the morning in Dec/1 and was able to solve the problem, clearing the JDF job history and had to restart the ""IHPS"" + ""Apache"" services on Prerip.

I am opening this case to register the problem and apply my labor onsite.

Thank you!

Thiago Andrade

MP206 | B&F | Web Break after loading new paper roll

I got onsite Dec/1 and helped operator Steve to investigate a web break. Apparently the new Paper Roll loaded had some damages in the edge causing the web break.

We have inspected paper-path, Idler Rollers, Tension Settings, Load Cell reactions, Tension and Draw Ratio trends and all was showing in a good shape.

I have monitored the press to guarantee the issue would not repeat.

SP11 | B&F | DFE not ripping and buffering JDF files sent via Connex

 Both presses SP32 and SP11 were shutdown for long weekend - Thanksgiving holiday, so early on Monday, Bowanie called me directly asking for help on it so I tried to help in the phone while driving, so we tried the procedure to clean JDF job history on APP1 but it did not help to solve the issue. 

I got onsite early in the morning in Dec/1 and was able to solve the problem, clearing the JDF job history and running PurgeAll.bat to clear the rips. The files were getting ""rip-failures"". 

I am opening this case to register the problem and apply my labor onsite.

Thank you!

We are experiencing issues with the Contiweb press, which stops working during the splice process. The interface displays a ""Press Quick Stop"" message, and after 20 seconds, it indicates that the ""Festoon is not ready for splice."" The paper being used is 80 lb with a width of 19 inches.

During troubleshooting, we performed a power cycle and adjusted the thickness with the press operator. After these adjustments, the Contiweb operated smoothly for the first roll splice from #1 to #2. However, when attempting to splice from #2 back to #1, the same error reoccurs, causing the press to stop.

This issue results in significant downtime, particularly on the finishing line, as the operator must rerun the calibration process.

Closure notes: Mr. Charles Tuider closure notes: We have other active cases still open for this issue, but our customer wants a new case number for their records. As detailed in the other cases this press continues to intermittently shut down entirely in the middle of printing. Press does not give much indication as to what explicitly is causing the shut down and we have been unable to narrow down what the source is. Issue comes and goes but always seems to initially hit while we are running high coverage jobs, and then like today will continue to shut down even while idle until it sits offline for a bit. Press is back up and into production now after we let it sit powered down for a couple of hours.

Hi Jeff, after further investigation it looks like the OS on the RIP6 server was somehow corrupted and I will need to reimage it. I will pick back up on this issue tomorrow morning. In the meantime the press is fine to continue running with the other rips as it has been

Is it possible to hold off on ripping new jobs or printing for a few minutes after you finish this batch of jobs? I removed RIP6 from the DFE and it is best for the press and job submission to be idle to readd it. This should take 5-10 minutes or so

PE2 OP+1 was giving an invalid FW message, updated the FW via the 9105 page.
Restarted IRIS
Ran SUC again, print looks good, but OP will not calibrate.  Customer has B&H coming in for another issue tomorrow and would like them to take a look at this also.
